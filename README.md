# What is the impact of Summer Festivals on Airbnb Listings
## Project Overview
Summer festivals offer a fun and engaging experience that attracts more people every year, from all over the world. Factors like artist line up, type of activities or the city where the festival is located contribute to people traveling for these events. 
Our research has the goal of understanding how Airbnb prices fluctuate during festival season, since this information is crucial for both travelers and hosts. For travelers, such information can aid in budget planning and accommodation selection during festival seasons, potentially optimizing their overall experience. Additionally, for hosts, insights into pricing dynamics during these peak periods can inform strategic pricing decisions, maximizing revenue generation. 
For this research we will analyze the impact of a popular festival in Barcelona, “Primavera Sound” on the Airbnb availability and prices.

## Objectives
Trend Analysis: Identify the overall trends in the Airbnb market, including growth patterns and shifts in consumer preferences.
Duration Insights: Understand the common lengths of stays and how they vary by location, apartment type, and season.
Seasonality Patterns: Examine how the availability and prices of apartments fluctuate throughout the year to pinpoint high and low demand periods.
Availability Dynamics: Analyze the factors influencing the availability of Airbnb apartments, including regulatory impacts, market saturation, and host preferences.
Data Source
The data for this project has been sourced from publicly available Airbnb datasets. These datasets include detailed listings information, such as location, price, availability, and reviews for various apartments across multiple cities and countries.

## Methodology
Our analysis utilizes a combination of statistical methods and machine learning models to dissect the Airbnb data. We employ Python for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for predictive modeling.
