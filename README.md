# What is the impact of Summer Festivals on Airbnb Listings

![Image](summerfestivals.jpg)

## Motivation
Summer festivals offer a fun and engaging experience that attracts more people every year, from all over the world. Factors like artist line up, type of activities or the city where the festival is located contribute to people traveling for these events. 
Our research has the goal of understanding how Airbnb prices fluctuate during festival season, since this information is crucial for both travelers and hosts. For travelers, such information can aid in budget planning and accommodation selection during festival seasons, potentially optimizing their overall experience. Additionally, for hosts, these insights can inform between strategic pricing decisions, maximizing revenue generation. 
For this research we will analyze the impact of a popular festival in Barcelona, “Primavera Sound” on the Airbnb apartments availability and prices.

**"Does the presence of a Summer Music Festival influence the prices of Airbnb listings in the respective city?"**

**"Is it possible to create a model that helps Airbnb hosts to define the pricings of their listings?"**

## Method and Results
The data was collected through the Inside Airbnb website (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data), for the city of Barcelona. The data was uploaded into RStudio, namely the CSV files of the listings and calendar.
Regression Analysis is the method used in this research, since it is a powerful tool to examine the relationship between festival season (independent variable) and the Airbnb Listing prices (dependent variable).
